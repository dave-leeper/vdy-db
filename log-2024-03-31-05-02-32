I've personally never used Lyft/Uber-type services and certainly didn't want to start with a 4:00am pickup for the airport. I was unable to secure a backup ride for both sides of my trip, so started looking into other options when I came across Vince Drives You.\n\nAll I can say is the entire experience from pre-booking inquiries to arriving home after my return flight was perfect on every level. Vince quickly responded to a website inquiry and we quickly began to text. All rates were locked in ahead of time and he was always within reach if changes were made to flight itinerary or just confirming we were set after the long gap between booking and day of.\n\nBrendan was my driver to the airport and arrived at 4:00am on the nose. He was super personable and bent over backwards to ensure there was nothing I wanted or needed on the journey. Even when road construction had the would-be exit closed, he quickly knew where to pivot in order to still arrive on time.\n\nVince himself picked me up for the ride home. The Waste Management Open was kicking off so traffic was heavier than usual with rain coming down to boot. He easily navigated the obstacles in order to keep things moving along and was equally as friendly and knowledgeable in all capacities.\n\nWhile airport transportation service obviously comes to mind for a business such as this, I would recommend keeping it in mind for anything from a game night out, date night dinner reservation, parties, etc. It is certainly much nicer and more reliable than an Uber or Lyft and likely much cheaper than a cab or limo service. This was a flawless transaction and I would highly recommend (and certainly use again myself) Vince Drives You for any type of shuttling needs.","id":"review:99"},{"replyingTo":99,"image":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/P5CU_mkQeRZtDwo6g9Vpeg/30s.jpg","name":{"first":"Vincent","last":"S"},"date":"02/09/2024","title":"Business Owner","reply":"Wow, thanks Joshua, I really appreciate your kind words.

I've personally never used Lyft/Uber-type services and certainly didn't want to start with a 4:00am pickup for the airport. I was unable to secure a backup ride for both sides of my trip, so started looking into other options when I came across Vince Drives You.\n\nAll I can say is the entire experience from pre-booking inquiries to arriving home after my return flight was perfect on every level. Vince quickly responded to a website inquiry and we quickly began to text. All rates were locked in ahead of time and he was always within reach if changes were made to flight itinerary or just confirming we were set after the long gap between booking and day of.\n\nBrendan was my driver to the airport and arrived at 4:00am on the nose. He was super personable and bent over backwards to ensure there was nothing I wanted or needed on the journey. Even when road construction had the would-be exit closed, he quickly knew where to pivot in order to still arrive on time.\n\nVince himself picked me up for the ride home. The Waste Management Open was kicking off so traffic was heavier than usual with rain coming down to boot. He easily navigated the obstacles in order to keep things moving along and was equally as friendly and knowledgeable in all capacities.\n\nWhile airport transportation service obviously comes to mind for a business such as this, I would recommend keeping it in mind for anything from a game night out, date night dinner reservation, parties, etc. It is certainly much nicer and more reliable than an Uber or Lyft and likely much cheaper than a cab or limo service. This was a flawless transaction and I would highly recommend (and certainly use again myself) Vince Drives You for any type of shuttling needs.","id":"review:99"},{"replyingTo":99,"image":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/P5CU_mkQeRZtDwo6g9Vpeg/30s.jpg","name":{"first":"Vincent","last":"S"},"date":"02/09/2024","title":"Business Owner","reply":"Wow, thanks Joshua, I really appreciate your kind words.
