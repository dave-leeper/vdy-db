[{"for":"about","text":"Vince Drives You is a Luxury SUV Transportation Service serving the Valley of the Sun. Advance reservations are required. I have an on-time pickup guarantee which means if you're not picked up on time you get a $50 discount on that trip, not a future credit. You can't do better anywhere.\n\nIf you are looking for a spacious, clean and comfortable trip then calling me is the only number you need to know. Rates start at a minimum charge of $60 and hourly packages are available. Hourly rates start at $90 per hour with a 3- hour minimum for a Black Suburban. I now have a Mercedes Sprinter with an 15 passenger capacity (including driver) available for larger party pick ups at the airport or your special event. The Sprinter starts at $150 per hour with a 4- hour minimum or you can get point to point service for only $250 in the Valley Metro area. You will know your full fee before your trip is confirmed regardless of how far in advance your service is booked and there are never hidden fees or charges.","id":"text:0"},{"for":"reviews","text":"A word about my service, my website is new, my service is not. The first 48 reviews were brought in from my Yelp ad and my Google Business page. All of my initial reviews have been imported exactly as they were written and I'm unable to edit them. As for my replies, I make mistakes, yes I'm human, so I'm able to edit my replies. Thanks so much for being here and I hope you like my reviews\n\nVince","id":"text:1"}]
